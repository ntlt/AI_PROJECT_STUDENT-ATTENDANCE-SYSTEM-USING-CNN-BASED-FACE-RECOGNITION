# STUDENT-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM-USING-CNN-BASED-FACE-RECOGNITION
Recognize The faces And Take Automatic Attandance. âœ¨

A student attendance system using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based face recognition involves using computer vision and machine learning. When the students attend a class, the camera captures their images, and the CNN model is used to identify and match their faces with their pre-registered profiles. The attendance of the students is then recorded automatically, without the need for manual intervention.
